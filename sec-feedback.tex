\section*{Course Feedback}
\textbf{Donggyu:} This course was very helpful to understand the flow of VLSI designs. I had no background knowledge on VSLI CAD tools, but now, I'm familiar with Sysnopsys tools through labs and the project. It's also good opportunity to learn basic circuit backgrounds and VLSI design patterns which I'm weak at. I'm generally satisfied with this course. One thing I was not satisfied with is it takes extremely long time due to CAD tool running times. I'm not sure we have to execute DC in a topographical mode for the labs because we will run ICC later. I think we can reduce running times by excluding unnecessary design environment and constraints.
