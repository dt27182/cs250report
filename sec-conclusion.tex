\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we presented the systems for automatic pipelining built on Chisel. To help the automatic pipelining figure out the optimal placement of the pipeline registers, the Chisel backannotator annotates Chisel graphs with delay information from logic synthesis. The automatic pipelining tool then optimizes pipeline register locations through simulated annealing using the annotated Chisel graphs. The tools are expected to relieve burdens of architects because pipelining a datapath by hand is tedious and error-prone.

The results of the Chisel backannotator show that it can calculate accurate critical path delays of most of designs in the Chisel tutorial except some designs such as Adder, BasicALU, and Risc. To improve the Chisel backannotator's accuracy, we will develop more elaborated delay estimation for missing signals by mapping them to appropriate nets in the gate netlists. Also, the Chisel backannotator will have a mapping from logic cells to Chisel nodes, which is used to calculate not only delays, but area and power numbers.

The results of the automatic pipelining tool show that (to be filled)
